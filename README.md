Fujita_2010
===========

Model by Fujita et al 2010 as one of the proposed benchmark models provided by Hass et al. 2019. The model represents epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt pathway. Data from [Fig. 1b] with a corresponding EGF step input from [Fig. 1a] in Fujita et al. 2010 was used for estimation and Global Sensitity Analysis of 12 parameters. We performed parameter estimation starting from the model parameters provided in the publication, using a search space 5 order of magnitude above and below for each parameter.
