Fujita_2010
===========

Model taken from Fujita et all.
Figure 1B was used for parameter estimation and scoring for Global Sensitivity Analysis.
We performed parameter estimation starting from the model parameters provided in the paper,
using a search space 5 order of magnitude above and bellow for each parameter.
